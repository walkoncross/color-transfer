Color Transfer Between Images
-----------------------------

A simple color transfer application, 
based on the method presented in this paper:

The chief difference is that the "rate" of transfer per channel can be
controlled by sliders in the application. The motivation for this is
that sometimes transferring 100% of the properties from the reference
image often leads to overcorrected results; it is often more desirable
to manipulate the rate of transfer for each channel individually.
